                                    We have been working on a way for your customers to be able to track and manage their loyalty cards online (if they want to). This is the first phase.<br><br>
                                    <b>At the moment:</b><br>
                                        - 'My Nimbus' is a site for your customers to be able to track their loyalty card balances quickly and with minimal fuss.<br>
                                        - The key is to make sure they have provided you with their email address for their customer account.<br>
                                        - And with this email address they can go to my.nimbuspos.com and choose to login with a password of their choosing or just get an email message of all their latest loyalty card balances. <br>

                                    <b>Upcoming:</b><br>
                                        Near-term:<br>
                                         - Soon, (before the holiday season), customers will be able to transfer their gift/loyalty cards to others. (For those that want to buy a loyalty card as a gift for someone else)<br>
                                        Long-term:<br>
                                         - View their order history <br>
                                         - An iOS and Android app (if there is demand for it)<br>
                                         - Ability for them to see your latest menu items<br>
                                         - And more... but we'll start slow<br><br>

                                    Of course, all of this is open to your feedback. For now, we are testing it out internally with our business owners and their teams. We would NOT recommend actively telling ALL your customers about this but if a customer specifically asks for a way to track online you can point them to this. To help with telling customers who ask for this, We've added a button in the POS, under the Customer's details view (below the "Notes and Preferences" field), labeled "Email Instructions". You can use this to send the customer an automatic email about how to track their loyalty and the site address.<br><br>

                                    You can now add multiples of the same loyalty card to the order. And as usual, you can apply the total value of the cards to redeem items in the same order. <br><br>

                                    1. For situations where a large quantity (>5) of an item is being ordered, you can now simply enter the quantity directly. Click on 'Options' for that order item and you will notice that the quantity number becomes editable. You can now click on it and enter whatever quantity is being ordered. Note: quantity entered must be > 0 and a whole number.<br><br>
                                    2. For businesses that have a lot of 'Category' tiles, you will notice that you no longer need to scroll. All of your 'Category' tiles will be visible at all times. This is to eliminate an extra step during the ordering process.<br><br>
