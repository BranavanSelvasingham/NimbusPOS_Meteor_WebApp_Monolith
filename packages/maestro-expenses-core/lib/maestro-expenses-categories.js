Multiply the result by the business part of your total home expenses. This will give you the household cost you can deduct. If you run the business for only part of the week or year, reduce your claim accordingly. For more information, see Interpretation Bulletin IT-514, Work Space in Home Expenses. \rThe capital gain and recapture rules will apply if you deduct capital cost allowance on the business use part of your home and you later sell your home.
